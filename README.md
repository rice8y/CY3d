./install.sh
```

## Usage

```tex
\CalabiYau[colormap]{power}{angle}{mesh size}
```

**Parameters:**

 - power: The degree (or exponent) of the Calabi-Yau equation $z_{1}^{n}+z_{2}^{n}=1$.
 - angle: The angle parameter to adjust the rotation or perspective of the surface.
 - mesh size: Defines the resolution of the mesh for plotting the surface.
 - colormap (option): Specifies the color scheme used for rendering the surface. This is based on the TikZ colormap. The default colormap is jet.
